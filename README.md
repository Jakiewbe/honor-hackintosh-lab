# HONOR Hackintosh Lab — Intel + NVIDIA macOS Compatibility Research

**Research-only repository. Do not deploy drivers to the primary Windows laptop.**

Target hardware:
- HONOR GLO-FX6P / Intel Core i5-12500H
- Intel Iris Xe iGPU: `8086:46A6` (internal display connected to Intel)
- NVIDIA RTX 2050 Laptop GPU: `10DE:25A9`

Upstream source reference: [NullMoth NVIDIA macOS Driver](https://github.com/nullmoth/nvidia-macos-driver), pinned at `0960b2ef5dbc4a573056d4c8e042a5bd2e15d651`.

## R0.6: Manual macOS Intel preflight

The [Actions workflow](.github/workflows/macos-preflight.yml) runs **only on explicit manual dispatch** using `macos-15-intel`. It requests GitHub token permission `contents: read`, has a 12-minute job timeout, and does not use secrets or upload artifacts.

### Run the first check

1. Go to **Actions** → **HONOR R0.6 macOS Intel preflight**.
2. Choose **Run workflow** on `main`.
3. Choose **mode: preflight** and click **Run workflow**.
4. Wait for the run result. Share its run URL or copied failure details for analysis.
5. **Only after preflight succeeds**, optionally choose **mode: source**. It fetches the pinned upstream Git commit, checks known source blob hashes, and compiles a standalone C++ x86_64 ABI smoke binary.

The first check uses a hosted Mac and consumes GitHub Actions capacity; review your GitHub billing settings before triggering it. Public repository standard GitHub-hosted runners are generally free under GitHub's public-repository rules. No run has been initiated by this repository setup.

### Scope and validation limits

This workflow can check Xcode 16, x86_64, Kernel.framework headers, the selected macOS SDK, pinned source integrity and a standalone ABI layout smoke test.

It **does not** compile, sign, install, load, test or distribute an NVIDIA/Intel kernel extension. It never modifies an EFI, BIOS, disk partition, or the primary HONOR Windows installation. Success does **not** prove RTX 2050 Metal support or Intel Iris Xe laptop display output.

### Files

- [`.github/workflows/macos-preflight.yml`](.github/workflows/macos-preflight.yml) — manual-only macOS Intel Actions workflow.
- [`scripts/verify_pinned_source.py`](scripts/verify_pinned_source.py) — read-only commit and source blob integrity checks.
- [`tests/abi_smoke.cpp`](tests/abi_smoke.cpp) — standalone C++ x86_64 ABI check, not a kext compile.

## Safety and evidence

The original NullMoth source carries a PolyForm Noncommercial license. No upstream source code or vendor firmware is copied into this repository. All upstream code is fetched from its public GitHub repository into an ephemeral runner only when source mode is explicitly requested.

The NVIDIA and Intel graphics bridge remains experimental. PCI device IDs in a source table and simulated tests are not sufficient proof of hardware acceleration or a working laptop screen.
